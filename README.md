# Capstone
If you need to recreate the capstone.db just run the initiate_table.py.
Otherwise this is a pretty straigh forward menue driven application. 
Run the capstone.py file, log in, and pick which options you would like. 
One thing is when you create a user you can not assign them as a manager, you will have to create a user and then go in and modify them from a user to a manger. This was on purpose to prevent accidental assignment as managers have a lot of privelages.
if you would like to add data to the CSV file. the one uploaded is assessment_result.csv. All of the others are test data for to populate the initial table.
